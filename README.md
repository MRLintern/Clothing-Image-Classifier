### Clothing Classification

This project looks at classifying various items of clothing from images; not particularly interesting I know but Convolution Neural Networks are!

### Introduction

We imagine that we work at an online fashion marketplace.
Users upload thousands of images of clothes to sell every day.
The key task here is to help users create listings faster by automatically recommending
the right cateogory for the clothes they wish to sell.
To do this a model for image classification is required.
The model used for this type of problem is a **Convolution Neural Network**.

### Dataset

The dataset consists of 3 folders: `test`, `train` and `validation`.
Within each of these folders there are folders of images such as: `dress`, `hat`, `shirt`, etc.


#### Tools Required

* `TensorFlow`: library for building multiple Machine Learning tasks.
* `Keras`: Neural Network Library which runs on top of `TensorFlow`.
* `Python`.
* `Jupyter Notebooks`.


### Instructions

 * `$ git clone https://github.com/MRLintern/Image-Classifier.git && cd Image-Classifier`
 * `$ jupyter notebook`

Instead of running the notebooks, copy/write in the code into each cell and run.

### TODO
Provide better notes for notebooks. Some notebooks will need running again to generate data for saving; not loaded in this repo.
